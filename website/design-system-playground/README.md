Design System Playground

What it is
- A tiny Storybook-like playground to validate visuals as you extend components.
- Features: simple hash-based routing to toggle previews; lightweight, CSS-only visuals using your design-system tokens.

How to run
- Open `design-system-playground/index.html` in a browser.
- Use the left navigation to switch between component previews.

What’s included
- Panels, GlyphDivider, StatusBadge, ListRow, Telemetry chart, and a DarkMode toggle visual.
- A minimal router in `design-system-playground/design-system-demo-playground.js` for end-to-end previews.

Next steps
- Wire this into a real React-based Storybook-like setup if you want stronger typing and interactions.
- Add prop panels that let you tweak component props live (text, icons, states).
