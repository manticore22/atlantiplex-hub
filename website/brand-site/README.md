Brand Site Patch – Seraphonix Studios

Overview
- A polished MVP landing page that embodies the Seraphonix brand bible: mythic-technical, sovereign, and architecturally ritual.

What’s included
- Static single-page layout with sections: Hero, Architecture, Pillars, Voice, Contact.
- Design tokens and color palette aligned to Brand Bible.
- Lightweight CSS grid, responsive typography, and accessible markup.
- SVG assets: logo-spiral-eye.svg and spiral-motif.svg (placeholders).
- Tiny JS to enhance navigation and accessibility cues.

Usage
- Open brand-site/index.html in a browser. The page is ready to patch into a larger site or evolve into a React/Vite app later.

Next steps (optional)
- Add a more elaborate architecture diagram and a real content map from the Brand Bible.
- Integrate with a content management system or a tiny React app for interactivity.
- Swap placeholder emails and add a proper CTA workflow.
