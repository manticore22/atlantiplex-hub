Design System Gateway

- A gateway (interactive hub) for exploring, validating, and extending the design system.
- Features: live playground, docs, a11y samples, and a lightweight component explorer.
- Uses existing design-system tokens and CSS, with a zero-build, browser-based playground.

How to use
- Open index.html in a browser or host it in your dev server.
- Use the left navigation to switch between Overview, Playground, Docs, and Accessibility.
- In Playground, explore components and see a live preview area.

Next steps
- Wire a React-based Storybook, or keep iterating with the lightweight in-repo gateway.
- Add more live controls to the Playground and create a11y automated checks.
