Stage Display Server

Usage:
- Run: node web/stage/server.js
- Open: http://localhost:9001 (or port defined by STAGE_PORT)

Notes:
- This is a starting point for a multi-party stage display. Integrations (WebRTC signaling, panellist feeds, and AI co-host) can be wired here as the next steps.
- The UI is designed to blend with the Atlantiplex deep-sea facility aesthetic while keeping the current vibe.
